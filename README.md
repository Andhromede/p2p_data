# ***Pire2Pire.com*** : An online training platform 

**What is Pire2pire.com ?**
Pire2pire.com is an online training platform center where students can register and follow trainings, chapters and lessons. <br>

The website also has a coach part which allows (for users that has the coach role) to create trainings, chapters and modules and assign them tags.

Once a student finish an online course, he can set it as done, increasing the completion gauge of a training. A training is completed when every chapters has been marked as completed.

**Current project objective:**
Create an API that allows to interact with a database and manage a few entities by modifying routes thanks to a controller and tools like Postman.

## **1. Detailed content**
We had to create two different type of content :
- Visible content that can be read by everyone (ex: chapters, lessons).
- Managing content that organize and restrict (ex: tag, permissions).

### **Visible content**
Currently, there is only three content that students and coachs can read :
- **Training**: Each training contains one or more chapters and has a title and a completion gauge, increasing depending of the number of chapters completed.
- **Chapters**: Each chapters contains one or more lessons. It also has a title, a description and a duration.
- **Lessons**: Defined with a title, a goal (what's the objective of the lesson) and a subject (what you'll learn in that lesson).

// TO-DO: Talk about tags. Talk about active state.

### **Managing content**


## **2. Technologies**

### **PostgreSQL**

### **TypeORM**

### **NestJS**

## **3. Current state of the project**
